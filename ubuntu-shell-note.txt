To show the time format in different format from terminal like 
DATE : jan 2014
TIME : 6:15:59

we  can use the command 

$ date '+DATE : %m  %y %n TIME : %H%:%M:%S

here % means a variable from system is  following  '  …...............' means its a script  and the result inside ' …...' will come in string and we can treat it as an string and use some string functionality on it like 
%n for  new line 
%t for a tab 
etc 




FOR GITHUB :

$ git init – for initiating git in a specific folder 

# then follow the instruction to set up ssh protocal in github

aftern neing set up

$ git commit -a to commit all and select which to save and which to not save 

$ git push -u origin master : to push the directory as master 

 but remember you cant do push as master without doing anyth at least you  have to commit something at first 




THE CAT COMMAND

$ cat filename  - to open that file from cat
$ cat > filename – this opens  that  file for you to write makign it an emopty filename
$ cat < filename  - it puts the string in the file into command to see 
$touch filename1 ,  file name2 , filename3 …............  – to open a empty normal text document with file names seperated by comma ,  if only on file name is given that creates only one file 

$cat file1 file2 ….................. > new file  - this will marge the test content of  file1 ,file2, file3,..... to filen to the new file called 'new file '



RENAME :

mv old_file_name  new_file_name –-----To rename any file or direcory

if there are spaces in any of the names then we put that name in '    …' this colon 
 for example  if I have to change a file / dir from laxman to laxman bhattrai the  what I have to execute is 

mv laxman 'laxman bhattarai'



DELETE :

to delte a file :

rm file_name

but if its directory that we are deleting the  we have to delte the files recursively ( -r )
that is :

rm -r file_name.

Or rmdir  directory_name will also delete a empty directory.
