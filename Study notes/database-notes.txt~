CHAPTER 1  : INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE
*******************
*******************

DATABSE :
##########
Database is a collection of logically connected / interrelated 
data and description of data designed to meet the infromantion need for that organization.

DATABASE SYSTEM:
###############
Database System (Database + DBMS Software) is an integrated collection of related files along with the deatails about their definition , interepration , manipulation and maintainance.

DBMS :
######
A DBMS software is a set of precedures that manages the database and provide the access to database in the form required by application program . It effectively ensures that 
necessary data in the desired form  is aviliable for diverse application of different organization

Application 1:

Application 2: 
             view 2--------------- DBMS ------------> Database
Application 3:
             view 3 --------------



Objectives :
############

-> A database should provide for effective storage , up to date and retrival of data
-> A databse should be reliable the stored data should be highly integrative and promote user trust in data.
-> A databse should be adaptable, scalable to new and uniform requirements and applications 
-> A database should identify the existance  of comon data and avoid duplicate recordings , selective redundancy is someting allowed to improve performance or for better reliability 

Chracteristics of Databse :
############################

-> Structure    
               * data types
               * data behaviour
-> Presistance 
-> store data on secondary storage
-> Retrival 
           * A declarative query language 
           * A procedural databse programming language 
-> Performance 
           * Retrive and store data quickly correctly
-> Sharing 
           * Concurrency ( same data being  shared in diffrent    applications ).
-> Reliability and Resilience 
-> Large volumes 

-> And database approach should be self describing nature , there should be insulation between program, data and 
   data abstraction.
-> the databse approach should support multiple views and also sharing of data and multi - user transcation processing .


## data in the databse has some chracteristics that are :

** they are shared , presistance ( data in the database remains permanently ) , integraty ( data should be correct with respect to their corresponding  realworld objects ) , secure and consistant ( data must be consistance wtht the data type that stores in )


######################################
    DATABSE SYSTEM VS FILE SYESTEM 
######################################
 1 . data redudancy and inconsistancy :   multiple file types and reduntency of  information in different files 
 2 . Difficulty to access data from files as we have to know the architecture of information storage in the files  but 
     in database management system we can input and output using simple  database queries
 3 . data isolation : diffrent data and informations are stored in diffrent files and format which makes it tough to extract 
      and input  data .
 4 . very hard to change the existing information in file and add new information.
 5 . concurret access and concurrent changes in a same file may lead to ambuigity whcih is better dealt with in database system .
 6 . Security Problems : databse system  makes it possible to provide user access some but not all data .
 7 . automicity problem : failure in between two partial states may lead to inconsistancy  is dealt better with databse system  
     Eg. transfer of fund from one bank to another should either complet or not happean at all 

     In the above activity databse system is offers solutions  entire problems of above .
