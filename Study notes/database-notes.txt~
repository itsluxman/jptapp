*******************

DATABSE :
##########
Database is a collection of logically connected / interrelated 
data and description of data designed to meet the infromantion need for that organization.

DATABASE SYSTEM:
###############
Database System (Database + DBMS Software) is an integrated collection of related files along with the deatails about their definition , interepration , manipulation and maintainance.

DBMS :
######
A DBMS software is a set of precedures that manages the database and provide the access to database in the form required by application program . It effectively ensures that 
necessary data in the desired form  is aviliable for diverse application of different organization

Objectives :
############

-> A database should provide for effective storage , up to date and retrival of data
-> A databse should be reliable the stored data should be highly integrative and promote user trust in data.
-> A databse should be adaptable, scalable to new and uniform requirements and applications 
-> A database should identify the existance  of comon data and avoid duplicate recordings , selective redundancy is someting allowed to improve performance or for better reliability 

Chracteristics of Databse :
############################

-> Structure    
               * data types
               * data behaviour
-> Presistance 
-> store data on secondary storage
-> Retrival 
           * A declarative query language 
           * A procedural databse programming language 
-> Performance 
           * Retrive and store data quickly correctly
-> Sharing 
           * Concurrency ( same data being  shared in diffrent    applications ).
-> Reliability and Resilience 
-> Large volumes
